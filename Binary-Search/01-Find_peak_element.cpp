    Question - A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
               Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
               If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
               You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
               You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
    Testcases:- 
        Example 1:
            Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
            Output: 2
            Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
        Example 2:
            Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
            Output: 5
            Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 
                         or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
