Basic facts:-
    The sum of all the internal angles of a triangle is always 180o no matter how the triangle is constructed.
    The length of any side of a triangle is shorter than the sum of the other two sides.
    A triangle can always be split into two right triangles no matter how the triangle is constructed.

Formulas:-
    Area of a triangle is the region occupied by a triangle in a two-dimensional plane. The dimension of the area is square units. The formula for area is given by;
    Area = 1/2 x Base x Height

The perimeter of a triangle is the length of the outer boundary of a triangle. To find the perimeter of a triangle we need to add the length of the sides of the triangle.
P = a + b + c

Semi-perimeter of a triangle is half of the perimeter of the triangle. It is represented by s.
s = (a + b + c)/2

where a, b and c are the sides of the triangle.

By Heron’s formula, the area of the triangle is given by:
A = √[s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c)]

where ‘s’ is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

By the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle can be calculated by the formula:
Hypotenuse2 = Base2 + Perpendicular2
